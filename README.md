# -RaspberryPi-to-STM32-LoRa-Communication-SX1278-
This project demonstrates wireless communication over LoRa (SX1278) between a Raspberry Pi and an STM32 microcontroller. The Raspberry Pi acts as the transmitter, allowing a user to send custom messages to the STM32 receiver, which then sends back an acknowledgement (ACK) over LoRa.
